### Investing via Pepper Ventures. 
We have written an article describing Pepper Ventures' [investment thesis](https://medium.com/@pepperinvestmentfund/investment-outlook-of-pepper-ventures-in-2023-b4cad50647f0) in early 2023. Our recent investment focus on crypto infrastructure, Zero-knowledge proofs, AI&crypto, DeFi and GameFi, but more broadly, we carefully review every pitching we received in many different fields. If you'd like to pitching with us, please send your commentable Googld Doc to info@hercules.global or daniel.linfeng.zhou@gmail.com. 

### Angel Investing
I wrote my first investment check in 2014 and I'm happy to invest in innovative ideas. Since I'm a cryptographer, I'm extremely excited to talk about new ideas based on cryptography or cryptographer founders. Additionally, if you have worked with me in industry or someone else who has worked with me worked with you, then I'm open to chatting. If you'd like to pitching with me, please send your email to daniel.linfeng.zhou@gmail.com.
